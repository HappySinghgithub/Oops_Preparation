Ques-1  OOPs
* Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology to design a program using classes and objects.
* The main aim of object-oriented programming is to implement real-world entities, for example,
  object, classes, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
* The main purpose of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that 
  function

Ques-2	Procedural Programming vs Object-Oriented Programming
	    Procedural Programming			     Object-Oriented Programming
     *  In procedural programming, the program	      * In object-oriented programming, the

     *  Procedural programming follows a	      * Object-oriented programming follows a 
	top-down approach				bottom-up approach.
     *  There is no access specifier in procedural    * Object-oriented programming has access

							protected, etc.
     *  Procedural programming does not have any      * Object-oriented programming provides

	secure.
     *	In procedural programming, overloading is     * Overloading is possible in object-
	not possible.					oriented programming.
     *  Procedural programming is based on the 	      * Object-oriented programming is based on 
	unreal world.					the real world.
     *  Examples: C, FORTRAN, Pascal, Basic, etc.     * Examples: C++, Java, Python, C#, etc.
     *  It does not have a scope for code reuse.      * It provides more scope for code reuse.

Ques-3       Advantages of OOP:
     *  Re-usability: Write once and use it multiple times, we can achieve this by using class.
     *  Redundancy: Inheritance is the good feature for data redundancy. If we need a same functionality in multiple class, we can write a common class for the same 
        functionality and inherit that class to subclass.
     *	Easy Maintenance: It is easy to maintain and modify existing code, as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones.
     *	Security: Using data hiding and abstraction only necessary data will be provided, thus maintains the security of data.

	     Disadvantages of OOP:
	Size: Object-Oriented Programs are much larger than other programs.
	Effort: Object-Oriented Programs require a lot of work to create.
	Speed: Object-Oriented Programs are slower than other programs, because of their size.

Ques-4     Structured Programming
     *  Structured Programming is a type of programming that generally converts large or complex programs into small pieces of code.
     *  These small pieces of codes are usually known as functions or modules or sub-programs of large complex programs.
     *	It is more user-friendly and easy to understand as compared to unstructured programming.
     *  Structured programs do not allow code duplication. 	
     * 	Structured programs use a greater number of data types as compared to unstructured programs.	
     *  It does not use GOTO to control the flow of execution. Instead, it uses loops. 	

	   Unstructured Programming
     *	Unstructured Programming is a type of programming that generally executes in sequential order i.e., these programs just not jumped from any line of code and 
        each line gets executed sequentially.
     *	It is also known as non-structured programming that is capable of creating turning-complete algorithms.
     *	It is less user-friendly and little hard to understand as compared to structured programming.
     * 	These programs allow code duplication.
     *  Unstructured programs use a limited number of data types as compared to structured programs.	
     *  It uses GOTO to control the flow of execution.

Ques-5 	   CLASS
     *  It is a logical entity. It can't be physical 	
     *	Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.	
     *	It is also a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. 
     *	Class doesn't consume any space.
     
     A class in Java can contain:
	       - Fields
	       - Methods
	       - Constructors
	       - Blocks
	       - Nested class and interface
	       
Ques-6 Instance variable in Java
	A variable which is created inside the class but outside the method is known as an instance variable. Instance variable doesn't get memory at compile time. It 
	gets memory at runtime when an object or instance is created. That is why it is known as an instance variable.
Ques-7 Method
	method is like a function which is used to expose the behavior of an object.
	A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
	You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.
	     - Create a Method
		A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses (). Java provides some pre-defined 
		methods, such as System.out.println(), but you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions:
	     - Call a Method
	        To call a method in Java, write the method's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon;
		
	  
	  OBJECT
     *  An object is a real-world entity.
     *	An object is a runtime entity.
     * 	Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object.
     * 	An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory. 
     *	For example, a chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike, etc. 
     *	It can be physical or logical.
	Example: Pen is an object. Its name is Reynolds; color is white, known as its state. It is used to write, so writing is its behavior.
	
	3 Ways to initialize object
	There are 3 ways to initialize object in Java.
	  - By reference variable
	  - By method
	  - By constructor
	
	There are many ways to create an object in java:-
     1.	Java newInstance() method
	The newInstance() method of Class class is used to create a new instance of the class dynamically. The newInstance() method of Class class can invoke only no 
	arg constructor of the class. This newInstance () method of the class does not consider any parameters or arguments from the class, which means that it doesn’t 
	possess any constructor; thus, it can be called the no-arg constructor for one class.
     2. Clone method()
     	The clone method() is a way to create exact copy of an object.
	Java provides an assignment operator to copy the values but no operator to copy the object. Object class has a clone method which can be used to copy the 
	values of an object without any side-effect. Assignment operator has a side-effect that when a reference is assigned to another reference then a new object is 
	not created and both the reference point to the same object. This means if we change the value in one object then same will reflect in another object as well. 
	clone() method handles this problem.
     3. Factory method()
     	Factory method is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes. The Factory 
	Method defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of using a direct constructor call
	
	Class vs Object
			Class								Object
     *  A class is a blueprint for declaring and creating object     *  An object is a class instance that allows programmers to use variables and 
                                              				methods from inside the class
     *  Memory is not allocated to classes. 	     		     *  When objects are created, memory is 		
     	Classes have no physical existence.				allocated to them in the heap memory. 		
     *  We can declare a class only once.	   		     *	A class can be used to create many objects. 					
     *  Class is a logical entity		    		     *  An object is a physical entity
     *  Class is created using the class keyword    		     *  Objects are created through new keyword like Dog d = new Dog();. 			
      	class Dog{}					       		We can also like create an object using the newInstance() method, clone() method, fatory method 
									and using deserialization. 	
     *  Example: Mobile is a class.		    		     *  If Mobile is the class then iphone, redmi, blackberry, samsung are its objects which have 
     									different properties and behaviours.		

Ques-8	Constructor
     *  constructor is used to initialize an object(not to create an object)
     *  constructor is a block of code (similar to method) having same name as that of class name.
     *	constructor does not have any return type, not even 'void'.
     * 	only 4 modifier are applicable for costructor i.e. public, private, protected, default. (static, final, synchronized etc cannot be used in constructor).
     *	constructor execute automatically when we create an object.
     Types of Constructor:-
     1. Default Constructor
     A constructor is called "Default Constructor" when it doesn't have any parameter.
     If we don’t create a constructor in a class, then the compiler creates a default constructor(with no arguments) for the class. And if we write a constructor with 
     arguments or no arguments then the compiler does not create a default constructor. 
     2. Parameterized constructor
     A constructor that has parameters is known as parameterized constructor. we pass the value of the parameter in the object of the class in parameterized 
     constructor.
     
Ques-9 Static method
	The static keyword is mainly used for memory management. We can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes. The static 
	keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.
	The static can be:
	- Variable (also known as a class variable)
	- Method (also known as a class method)
	- Block
	- Nested class
	1. static variable
	   If you declare any variable as static, it is known as a static variable. The static variable can be used to refer to the common property of all objects 
	   for example, the company name of employees, college name of students, etc. The static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class 
	   loading.

Ques-8      Encapsulation
	Encapsulation is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.
	The variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
	We can create a encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private.
	To achieve encapsulation in Java −
	Declare the variables of a class as private.
	provide public setter and getter methods to access and update the value of a private variable
	The main AIM of encapsulation is to hide the internal implementation of the class from the outside class.
